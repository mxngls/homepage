title: Five Questions Concerning the Literature Machine and Computer Programming

<p>
	The following is a loose collection of thoughts and questions that deal
	broadly with how the advent of LLMs and their continuous improvement are
	poised to influence and shape our industry or are already doing so. A few of
	these have at least partial answers while for most I have not yet arrived at
	a satisfying conclusion for myself. As such I expect to update this document
	continuously over the following months. I mostly limit myself to aspects of
	the ongoing discourse which I feel are currently underdiscussed.

				Will software engineering simply be less <em>fun</em>?
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Until now computer programming entailed, besides the obviously
			necessary knowledge about computer science, minute knowledge of lots
			of adjacent technologies. As of right now these seem to lose in
			importance significantly over the coming years. For someone who does
			not strictly take pride in this knowledge and the ability to use
			these tools productively, but rather derives <i>joy</i> from it,
			this shift troubles me.
		</p>
		<p>
			Naur already argued already in the 80s that the essence of
			programming lies in theory building and that the exact methodology
			applied - the how we work - does not really matter that much and is
			a rather adjunct part.<site-footnote

			It seems we are faced anew with the question of what exactly is
			computer programming and have yet to find an answer, for us as
			individuals and as an industry as a whole.

				Will the lack thereof or at least a significant reduction in
				manual labor mean the loss of hard-won earned unembodied
				knowledge?

			Creative and intellectual work involves inspiration, which does not
			conform to or follow strict rules and cannot be predicted. Getting
			rid of the majority of practices that constitute our work might lead
			to the loss of something valuable that has so far only existed in
			the intangible.

			<strong>What is the worth of moving slowly?</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			For a long time the conventional wisdom was that in order to improve
			as an engineer one has to work on implementations themselves if they
			really desired to understand the underlying theory behind it. I
			found this to be true for myself, but now development speed seems to
			be the prime factor occupying the minds of even the most senior
			members of our trade. I question if real learning is truly possible
			if all that's left for us as humans is
			<i>delegation</i> and the actual <i>implementation</i> will be left
			to the machine instead. While we might churn out code faster than
			ever, I'm not sure if our brains can necessarily keep up with that
			pace.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the other hand, moving fast and breaking things has been the
			ethos of Silicon Valley for as long as most of its members might
			remember and LLMs accelerate this dynamic, which above all rewards
			the quick and not the conscious, even further.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong
				>How can we make sure that we as a field advance in a way that
				allows for the continuous existence of its labor force?</strong
			>
		</p>
		<p>
			While the question could be interpreted as speaking about the
			obvious economic implications of the further automation that this
			new technology seems predetermined to bring upon us, what I want to
			focus on is something different.
		</p>
		<p>
			Adjacent to the previous point, LLMs have a tremendous potential to
			facilitate learning like nothing else before. They are correctly
			described as stochastically working and almost certainly lacking a
			real understanding of the underlying concepts of the given problem
			they are working on. But as models are evolving almost faster than
			we keep track of, it is becoming evident that especially when
			working on problems of limited depth their rate of failure is
			surprisingly low. Consequently private tutors for everyone -
			historically a luxury reserved only for the children of society's
			most prosperous - are already a reality today. When used responsibly
			they undoubtedly have the ability to level the playing field of
			education even more.
		</p>
		<p>
			But, learning requires attention and time. Sporadically reviewing
			the product of that probabilistic slot machine, or going even
			further, removing oneself from the loop entirely, erodes the
			attention necessary to reflect on unsolved problems and reach
			conclusions on our own. Refreshing social media feeds seems to have
			a similar effect as we no longer truly engage with content
			intellectually, and instead push ourselves towards maintaining a
			superficial distance. I fear that we as humans lack the necessary
			restraint to not fall victim to exactly this dynamic now in the
			context of intellectual work.
		</p>
		<p>
			The fact that this concern doesn't seem to be widely shared among
			others in our industry who are more experienced is troublesome to
			say the least.

		<p>
			<strong
				>Will this contribute to the existing social alienation felt by
				many and lead to decreased collaboration between us?</strong
			>
		</p>
		<p>
			Superficially broadening the knowledge of individuals might obsolete
			the necessity of collaboration between them. Paraphrasing from some
			private correspondence: we may be trading the messy, generative
			friction of human collaboration for the frictionless isolation of
			individual sufficiency. Here it is, again, questionable what the
			lost long-term value of this convenience might be.
